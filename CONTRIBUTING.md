# What's **holdem**?

I started this project during the COVID pandemic because
I wanted to be able to play free, no money, online Texas Hold'em, with
my friends, without creating an account or downloading software.
Because it's a side project it's slow going, but it's been a great
learning experience for myself and the other contributors, and we're
making great progress. :muscle:

### How to Contribute

We'd love new contributors. You don't even *have* to be a developer.
We have needs in:

- Design
- Product
- Frontend
- Backend
- DevOps

If you want to contribute:

- Fork the repository
- Look through the issues (we try to keep the queue filled)

Thank you! :heart:
